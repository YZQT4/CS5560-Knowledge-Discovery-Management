Glomeruli number and size are important for determining the pathogenesis of glomerular disease, chronic kidney disease, and hypertension. Moreover, renal injury can occur in specific cortical layers and alter glomerular spatial distribution. In this study, we present a comprehensive structural analysis of glomeruli in a model of Adriamycin (Doxorubicin) nephropathy. Glomeruli are imaged (micro-CT at 10×10×10µm
