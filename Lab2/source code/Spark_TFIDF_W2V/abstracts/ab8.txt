Peritoneal dialysis (PD) starters generally have a better outcome compared with hemodialysis (HD) starters, perhaps related to treatment characteristics or case mix. We previously showed that pre- and post-dialysis start clinical parameter trajectories are related to outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate these trajectories in PD and HD starters.
