Glomerular podocytes are highly specialized epithelial cells and play an essential role in establishing the selective permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier of kidney. Maintaining the viability and structural integrity of podocytes is critical to the clinical management of glomerular diseases, which requires a thorough understanding of podocyte cell biology. As mature podocytes lose proliferative capacity, a conditionally SV40 mutant tsA58-immortalized mouse podocyte line (designated as tsPC) was established from the Immortomouse over 20 years ago. However, the utility of the tsPC cells is hampered by the practical inconvenience of culturing these cells. In this study, we establish a user-friendly and reversibly-immortalized mouse podocyte line (designated as imPOD), on the basis of the tsPC cells by stably expressing the wildtype SV40 T-antigen, which is flanked with FRT sites. We show the imPOD cells exhibit long-term high proliferative activity, which can be effectively reversed by FLP recombinase. The imPOD cells express most podocyte-related markers, including WT-1, Nephrin, Tubulin and Vinculin, but not differentiation marker Synaptopodin. The imPOD cells do not form tumor-like masses
